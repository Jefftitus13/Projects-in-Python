# Project Title: Python Data Analysis and Visualization

## Overview
This Python project focuses on data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using various datasets, including dinosaur data, laptop data, phone data, house data, heroes information, and Marvel movies.

### Data Cleaning

#### Dinosaur Data
- Removed duplicate entries.
- Handled missing values by imputation or removal.
- Standardized naming conventions.

#### Laptop Data
- Addressed outliers by applying appropriate transformations.
- Checked for and handled null values.
- Ensured consistent data types.

#### Phone Data
- Removed irrelevant columns.
- Corrected inconsistencies in data entries.
- Dealt with outliers through appropriate methods.

#### House Data
- Handled missing values using interpolation techniques.
- Checked for and addressed data entry errors.
- Ensured uniform formatting.

#### Heroes Information
- Merged duplicate records.
- Checked for and handled missing or inconsistent data.
- Standardized data formats.

#### Marvel Movies
- Cleaned messy text data and standardized titles.
- Checked for and handled missing values.
- Ensured consistency in date formats.

### Data Analysis

Using the Netflix series dataset, the following analyses were conducted:

- Calculated the maximum and minimum IMDb ratings.
- Determined the movies with the maximum and minimum number of votes.
- Filtered genres based on certain IMDb rating requirements.
- Filtered certificates according to genres.

### Data Visualization

#### Matplotlib
Utilized Matplotlib for visualizing IMDb ratings and meta scores:

- Created charts to represent IMDb ratings and meta scores.
- Generated multiple charts using NumPy to showcase diversity.
- Utilized subplots to compare different aspects of the data.
- Implemented 3D visualization for a more comprehensive view.
